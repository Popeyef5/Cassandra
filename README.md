# Cassandra

### About

According to Greek mythology, Cassandra was a Trojan priestess simultaneously blessed with the gift of providence and cursed with the fact that no one was to believe her. It is then fitting that a simple simulation that attempts to model such a complex setting carries her name. This Cassandra, however, wants to break free from her curse. 

Currently written for enhanced readability, Cassandra allows from plug-and-play options to full customization to the deepest level.

Eventually, Cassandra will foresee all TVC powered flights, even those which are not mentioned to her. Until then, there's much to do.

### Instalation

For now, until we get Cassandra on PyPi, do:

```bash
pip3 install git+https://github.com/Popeyef5/Cassandra.git --upgrade
```

### TODO

Although there is plenty to do and everything is welcome, if you want to contribute but don't know how to, here are a couple of ideas that would come in handy:

* A logo is always nice :)
* Tests (pretty please?)
* GitHub actions
* Improve UI
* Improve animation
